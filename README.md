# evolutionary-work-group
My idea of a more natural way of organising work groups

Environment select groups succeeding doing a task:
* Organisms are Multi celular cells synchronizing themselves to survive.
* A pack of wolves hunt together better than alone.

This workflow will try to find solutions based on successful human groups:
* Family: first and minimal human group that last more than anyone else.
* Guild: as a successful way of mentor and specialize in an art
* Orchestra: split of concerns and synchronizing inside an art
* Army: as the most historically successful group to organize and deliver using hierarchies

Let's take what this groups have in common to find out the tools to build the best working group


## Hierarchies

The fair way is not always the quickest way, a father has to accept to punish their children when they misbehave risking himself to be on fair on one or all of them.

The best example is the army, where a group of people has a very strict hierarchy in order to take quick choices to beat other armies. It could be more fair that soliders vote how/what/who to implement a target, but when they come to an agreement they could be overpowered by another army with a strong (and unfair) hierarchy.

Hierarchies has a lot to do with the nexts common points

## Quickness over perfection

*A quick suboptimal choice is better than a late optimal one*, don't die by perfection, iterate the suboptimal.

Evolution works with with trial/error, without any intelligence driving the whole process. The result is a big mayority of deadly changes (the evolution subject to perform worst and perish) and successfull ones that improve the performing of the next generations.

No human group is perfect and it is in constant iteration: Families, guilds, orchestras or armies, make changes to trial/test better ways of perform better in their targets.
