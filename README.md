# evolutionary-work-group
My idea of a more natural way of organising work groups

Environment select groups succeeding doing a task:
* Organisms are Multi celular cells synchronizing themselves to survive.
* A pack of wolves hunt together better than alone.

This workflow will try to find solutions based on successful human groups:
* Family: minimal human group with the longest loving together
* Guild: as a successful way of mentor and specialize in an art
* Orchestra: split of concerns and synchronizing inside an art
* Army: as the most historically successful group to organize and deliver using hierarchies
