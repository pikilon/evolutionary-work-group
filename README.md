# evolutionary-work-group
My idea of a more natural way of organising work groups

> Agent means here: individual or sub-group inside a group.

Environment select groups succeeding doing a task:
* Organisms are Multi celular cells synchronizing themselves to survive.
* A pack of wolves hunt together better than alone.

This workflow will try to find solutions based on successful human groups:
* Family: first and minimal human group that last more than anyone else.
* Guild: as a successful way of mentor and specialize in an art
* Orchestra: split of concerns and synchronizing inside an art
* Army: as the most historically successful group to organize and deliver using hierarchies

Let's take what this groups have in common to find out the tools to build the best working group

## Hierarchies

The fair way is not always the quickest way, a father has to accept to punish their children when they misbehave risking  to be unfair on one or all of them: "You are the three grounded, so you all learn next time to organize yourself"

The best example is the army, where a group of people has a very strict hierarchy in order to take quick choices to beat other armies. It could be more fair that soliders vote how/what/who to implement a target, but when they come to an agreement they could be overpowered by another army with a strong (and unfair) hierarchy.

> Position in the hierarchies could not be related with rewards (salary)

A sport coach is higher in the hierchy than a star player, but the start player could earn 10x the salary of the coach. The rewards are related with other things, no _necesarily_ with hierarchies.

Hierarchies has a lot to do with the nexts common points

## Speed over perfection

> A quick suboptimal choice is better than a late optimal one

Don't die by perfection, iterate the suboptimal to become a good solution, never settle but accept the perfection doesn't exists.

Evolution works with with trial/error, without any intelligence driving the whole process. The result is a big mayority of deadly changes (the evolution subject to perform worst and perish) and successfull ones that improve the performing of the next generations.

No human group is perfect and it is in constant iteration: Families, guilds, orchestras or armies, make changes to trial/test better ways to perform better.

## Specialization

Especialization make species, groups and idividuals to be successful in nature.
Woman and Men has evidences on the specialization in their bodies and brains, we splitted the work in the past to success to raise our children.

> Every moment an agent (group or individual) spends on its non specialized work is a waste of time/money. 

In our society the **Orchestra** group is the best example of this specialization:
* The orchestra specialize in performing one type of music, usually classic
* The subgroups are specialized in instruments families as strings, brass, percussion and keyboards.
* The musicians are specialized in their position, the concertmaster is the first violin section inside strings.

Promoting specialization is improving the performance of a group: a piano player should never touch a guitar, even shouldn't waste time tuning the piano, or meetings deciding the difficulty of a the string section to perform something, we want the best at every role we can.

> We can't have the best possible Orchestra made by a group of one-man band. 

## Cohesion (promote competition with rewards, army, sports)
## Mentoring (Guild: teach to do something, avoid abstraction)
## Targets alignments (agents and group need to have their target aligned, career, profit, clear path)
## Single line of comunication, to many channels = no channel.

Meetings are evil, try to avoid by delegating in the involved agents and using hierarchy.
Army: The information is splitted to perform a very specialized task
